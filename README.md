## Proof that you had an idea first, by putting a digest into the blockchain. 

Appopreturn creates a unique digest of your data locally using state of the art cryptography. The digest value is then sent to our servers and we make an OP\_RETURN transaction with your digest value to the bitcoin blockchain. For free users we put that digest in the bitcoin testnet blockchain, for paying users we make the transaction in the bitcoin network.   
we provide you a link to the transaction. Keep your data safe. Feel free to use our service to calculate the digest later again. For pro users we have upcoming features like a digest transaction history and much more, so you don't have to keep track of your digests.   
It's the ideal tool for artists: imagine you have a great idea written in a file. It might be a photo, a text or even a program. You can settle the digest in the blockchain and together with the file you can later prove that you had the original idea. Publish with a pseudonym first, and if you have reached a breakthrough, proof that you have been the first\!
