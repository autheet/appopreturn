    <h1>Privacy Policy for AppOpReturn</h1>

    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 2023-10-27</p>

    <p>Thank you for using AppOpReturn ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we handle information when you use our application. Your privacy is of the utmost importance to us.</p>

    <h2>1. The Core Principle: Your Data Stays Yours</h2>

    <p>AppOpReturn is built on the principle of "proof of existence." Our service is designed to function without ever seeing, storing, or transmitting your original file or its contents. But remember: if you notarize a digest to the blockchain, the Time, the fact that this service was used and the digest becomes public. Very small datasets might be reconstructable from the digest. Keep that in mind.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We DO NOT Collect</h2>

    <p>We want to be crystal clear about what we <strong>do not</strong> collect from you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Your Files:</strong> The content of the files you select never leaves your device. But a cryptographic digest of your file will be public!</li>
        <li><strong>Your Filenames:</strong> The names of your files are not transmitted or stored.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We do not require you to create an account, and we do not collect any personal data such as your name, email address, location, or device identifiers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Information We DO Collect and How We Use It</h2>

    <p>To provide our service, we need to handle a minimal amount of data. Here is an exhaustive list of what we collect and store:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cryptographic Hash (Digest):</strong> When you select a file, our application calculates a <code>SHA-256</code> cryptographic hash of the file's content <em>locally on your device</em>. This hash is a unique string of characters that represents your file but does not reveal its content.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage and Usage of the Hash:</strong> We send this anonymous hash to our secure backend (Firebase Cloud Functions). We then store this hash in our Firestore database. The primary purpose of this is to embed the hash into a transaction on a public blockchain (the Bitcoin Testnet). This creates a permanent, timestamped proof of existence for the data corresponding to the hash. We also use the stored hash to prevent duplicate transactions for the same file, providing a more efficient service.</li>
        <li><strong>Transaction and Timestamp Information:</strong> When a blockchain transaction is created for a new hash, we store the resulting <code>transaction_id</code> and a <code>server_timestamp</code> (the date and time of the transaction) in our database, linked to the corresponding hash. If you process the same file again, we will retrieve the existing transaction ID from our records.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> We use Firebase Cloud Functions and Firestore to process and store the notarization request. This involves securely transmitting the anonymous hash to Google's servers. For more information, you can review <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Blockchain:</strong> The hash of your file is permanently recorded on a public blockchain network. This is by design, as it is essential for providing a verifiable proof of existence. Information on public blockchains is accessible to everyone and cannot be altered or deleted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>

    <p>We use industry-standard security measures, including HTTPS, to protect the anonymous hash during its transmission from the application to our backend.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>Our service is not directed to individuals under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect any information from children.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within our application and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
